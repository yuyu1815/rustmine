# Client Load Evidence

Purpose: provide a current evidence lens that separates proven compatibility
from structural observation for client-load and playability claims.

## Default Diagnostic Route

```text
1. Read docs/analysis/current-evidence/structural-scan.md
2. Treat path existence as observed_only
3. For client-load/playability diagnosis, start at the first missing or failing proof in the phase lens
4. For targeted later-phase, cross-phase, protocol-only, docs-only, review-only, or tooling work, use the owning shard named by the task/evidence
5. Add or update proof only through root-owned artifacts/tests/probes
6. Update docs/analysis/client-load/README.md and the phase detail file when phase evidence changed
```

## Evidence Snapshot

| Load phase | Proof state | Evidence | What this proves | What it does not prove |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `local_boot_resources` | `unproven` | none | nothing yet | startup, resources, assets, render setup |
| `network_login_configuration` | `partial` | `oracle/answers/775/configuration_keepalive_codec.answer.jsonl`; `oracle/test-manifests/775/configuration_keepalive_codec.test-manifest.json`; `oracle/rust-tests/tests/oracle_contracts.rs`; `bash oracle/scripts/run_jar_backed_oracle_tests.sh` | one Configuration serverbound keep-alive packet id/body matches official jar answer | full login/configuration runtime behavior, keep-alive response loop, finish configuration, play transition |
| `registry_hydration` | `unproven` | none | nothing yet | registry/dimension/known-pack/feature state |
| `play_entry` | `unproven` | none | nothing yet | successful entry into Play |
| `world_hydration` | `unproven` | none | nothing yet | chunks, light, block states, biomes, world time |
| `entity_player_hydration` | `unproven` | none | nothing yet | local player, remote players, entities, spawn readiness |
| `render_ready` | `unproven` | none | nothing yet | visible loaded world, screenshot/pixel readiness |
| `control_interact_ready` | `unproven` | none | nothing yet | movement, interact, inventory, combat after load |

## Snapshot Note

At this snapshot, the proven compatibility is only
`configuration_keepalive_codec`, jar-backed, and stored outside
`stevenarella/`.
